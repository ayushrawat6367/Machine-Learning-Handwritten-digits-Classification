# Machine-Learning-Handwritten-digits-Classification

Project Overview:
The project focuses on developing a neural network model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Key aspects covered in the project include hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and comparison with other neural network architectures.

Contents:
Code: Contains Python scripts for creating and training the neural network model, as well as scripts for data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, and model evaluation.
Documentation: Includes a detailed report summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions. Graphs and visualizations are provided to illustrate the analysis and findings.
Datasets: Includes the MNIST dataset used for training and testing the model.

Key Findings:
Hyperparameter tuning, particularly adjusting Lambda and the number of hidden units, significantly impacts the model's accuracy.
Optimal hyperparameters (Lambda = 15, hidden units = 16) were identified for maximizing accuracy on the validation and test datasets.
Comparison with FaceNN and CNN architectures revealed insights into performance variations based on architecture complexity and training time.
